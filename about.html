                  <p>Please join  me in this deep dive into my coding journey and also into my side hobbies 
                     and new digital projects</p>
                  <p>I have decided that in this day age with the power of the internet and these mini laptops 
             that a majority of the world have in their hands I want us to educate and assist each other for the benefit of the greater good. By providing info for those in needs of grants, free IVY league education,
                     and the availability of showers and necesities such as those for the homeless. I magine  just by doing a little research we can move mountains.</p>
